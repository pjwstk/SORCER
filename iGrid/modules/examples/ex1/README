This example contains Java sources for four examples:
	ex1run-bean-http
	ex1run-prv-http
	ex1run-bean
	ex1run-prv
	
http - in the name of the example directory indicates that 
service providers and requestors are bootstrapped with their own code servers,
otherwise both service providers and requestors require to have a code server 
(webster) already running.

To start the SORCER environment for these examples run the Ant script
${IGRID_HOME}/bin/iGrid-boot.xml or ${IGRID_HOME}/bin/iGrid-boot-http.xml

To start a service browser run the Ant script
${IGRID_HOME}/bin/browser/bin/service-browser-run.xml

To run an Ant script:
	a) in Eclipse IDE select an Ant script, then from a popup menu select "Run As/Ant Build"
	b) on a command line call "ant -f <script filename>"
