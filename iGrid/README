An intergrid (iGrid) is a generic framework for integrating multiple technology 
frameworks using the Service-ORiented Computing EnviRonment (SORCER). SORCER is a 
dynamically federated metacomputing environment that has been built and 
developed by SOPRCER Lab at SORCERsoft.org (http://sorcersoft.org)

To configure your iGrid, the following environment variable has to be defined:
IGRID_HOME - points to your iGrid workspace (sandbox)

BASIC CONFIGURATION
The required configuration files must be copied from iGrid/configs/templates 
to iGrid/configs. Never commit these files from your iGrid/configs directory 
to the source repository, after customizing them they belong to you only.
1.	sorcer.env
2.	sorcer.logging

In the sorcer.logging file, set logger levels accordingly to your development
and testing needs.

The data.formats file defines data-context-node types for various applications 
(similar to MIME types).

ADVANCED CONFIGURATION
Once copied, these files should be customized accordingly. In particular, 
the following properties in sorcer.env used by the sorcer.util.Env class should 
be declared:
provider.lookup.locators - locators used for unicast discovery
provider.webster - a class server hostname used by sorcer.util.Env
provider.webster.port - port of the iGrid class server used by sorcer.util.Env
sorcer.admin - to receive email notifications
sorcer.smtp.host - mail server
If you use an RMI registry, set sorcer.rmi.host and sorcer.rmi.port accordingly.

OFFLINE USE SEPARATE DESKTOP/DESKTOP SYSTEM NOT CONNECTED TO REPOSITORY 
(To Remove .svn folders) 
1. Make a backup of IGRID_HOME\data
2. Right-click on IGRID_HOME folder, select Team, then Export
3. Select Location
4. Click OK
5. Move IGRID_HOME folder to new system
6. On new system using Eclipse, File-->Import-->General-->Existing Projects into 
   Workspace
7. Click Browse and navigate to IGRID_HOME
8. Click Finish

WINDOWS XP 32/64-bit NOTES
1. Install eclipse workspace to c:\workspace or similar, try to avoid using 
   paths like c:\Program Files where the spaces can cause ANT trouble.
2. On 64-bit systems, may need to adjust Installed JREs to use the 64-bit one
   in C:\Program Files\Java\jre6 by using:
   Window-->Preferences-->Java-->Installed JRE's (Edit)
3. If there are problems using the localhost address or multiple adapters
   , try installing the Microsoft Loopback adapter and set it to use a 
   192.168.x.y address with 255.255.0.0 submask. 
   a.) Start-->Control Panel-->Add Hardware-->Next-->Yes,Next-->
       Add a new hardware device (at bottom of list), Next-->
       Install the hardware that I manually select from a list-->
       Network Adapters, Next-->
       Microsoft, Microsoft Loopback Adapter, Next-->
       Follow directions...manually set address to 192.168.x.y using Properties
       for adapter
